[IWSLT 2015](http://workshop2015.iwslt.org/): The IWSLT 2015 Evaluation Campaign featured three tracks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), spoken language translation (SLT), and machine translation (MT). For ASR we offered two tasks, on English and German, while for SLT and MT a number of tasks were proposed, involving English, German, French, Chinese, Czech, Thai, and Vietnamese.
