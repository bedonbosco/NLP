SimLex-999 Dataset [(Hill 2014)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3456.pdf)

SimLex-999 is a gold standard resource for evaluating distributional semantic models that improves on existing resources in several important ways. this focus on similarity, SimLex-999 incentivizes the development of models with a different, and arguably wider range of applications than those which reflect conceptual association. SimLex-999 contains a range of concrete and abstract adjective, noun and verb pairs, together with an independent rating of concreteness and (free) association strength for each pair. This diversity enables fine-grained analyses of the performance of models on concepts of different types, and consequently greater insight into how architectures can be improved. 

# Structure
[Dataset](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fh295/simlex.html)

SimLex-999 is structured to facilitate focused evaluations based around the following conceptual distinctions: 

* Concreteness: Each concept in each SimLex-999 pair is rated for its conceptual concreteness. Because abstract concepts are more common than concrete concepts in most everyday language ( and can behave quite differently in semantic models ), SimLex-999 contains a balanced selection of concrete ( dog, cup ) and abstract ( envy, deny ) concepts. 

* Part-Of-Speech: SimLex-999 comprises 666 Noun-Noun pairs, 222 Verb-Verb pairs and 111 Adjective-Adjective pairs. 

* Free-Association: SimLex-999 includes an independent empirical measure of the strength of association (or relatedness) between each of its pairs, taken from the University of South Florida Free Association Norms.
