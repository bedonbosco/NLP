The [SemEval ABSA task for 2016](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/) (SE-ABSA16) gives the opportunity to participants to further experiment with English data (reviews) from the domains of SE-ABSA15 (laptops, restaurants, hotels) by providing new test datasets. In addition, SE-ABSA16 will also provide datasets in other than English languages. For each domain (e.g. restaurants) a common set of annotation guidelines will be used across all languages. Furthermore, SE-ABSA16 includes text-level annotations along with a suitable evaluation methodology.
