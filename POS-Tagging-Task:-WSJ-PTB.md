**Datasets**

The WSJ-PTB (the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank Dataset) corpus contains 1.17 million tokens and has been widely used for developing and evaluating POS tagging systems. (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) employed one-against-all SVM based on manually-defined features within a sevenword window, in which some basic n-gram patterns were evaluated to form binary features such as: “previous word is the”, ”two preceding tags are DT NN”, etc.
