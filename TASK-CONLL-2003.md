# REUTERS DATA
[REUTERS dataset](http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html)

In 2000, Reuters Ltd made available a large collection of Reuters News stories for use in research and development of natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning systems. This corpus, known as "Reuters Corpus, Volume 1" or RCV1, is significantly larger than the older, well-known Reuters-21578 collection heavily used in the text classification community.
## Datasets
RCV1: Reuters Corpus, Volume 1, English language, 1996 to 1997. This is distributed via web download and contains about 810,000 Reuters, English Language News stories. It requires about 2.5 GB for storage of the uncompressed files.

RCV2: Reuters Corpus, Volume 2, Multilingual Corpus, 1996 to 1997. This is distributed via web download and contains over 487,000 Reuters News stories in thirteen languages (Dutch, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Italian, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish).

TRC2: Thomson Reuters Text Research Collection (TRC2). The TRC2 corpus comprises 1,800,370 news stories covering the period from 2008 to 2009 or 2,871,075,221 bytes, and was initially made available to participants of the 2009 blog track at the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), to supplement the BLOGS08 corpus (that contains results of a large blog crawl carried out at the University of Glasgow).
