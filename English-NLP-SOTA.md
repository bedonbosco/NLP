# Part-of-Speech Tagging

**[Wall Street Journal Section of Penn Treebank](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/POS-Tagging-Task:-WSJ-PTB)** <sub><sup>8 results collected</sup></sub>

The Penn Treebank (PTB) project selected 2,499 stories from a three year Wall Street Journal (WSJ) collection of 98,732 stories for syntactic annotation. These 2,499 stories have been distributed in both Treebank-2 (LDC1999T42) and Treebank-3 (LDC1999T42) releases of PTB. Treebank-2 includes the raw text for each story. Three "map" files are available in a compressed file (pennTB_tipster_wsj_map.tar.gz) as an additional download for users who have licensed Treebank-2 and provide the relation between the 2,499 PTB filenames and the corresponding WSJ DOCNO strings in TIPSTER.

# Text Classification

[`⚙ Tools`](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/English-NLP-Tools#text-classification) | [`⟰ Publications`](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/English-NLP-Publications#text-classification) | **`☶ SOTA`** | [`⚛ Services`](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/English-NLP-Services#text-classification)

**[AG’s news corpus](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/DATA-AGNEWS)** <sub><sup>22 results collected</sup></sub>

AG (GM Del Corso et al. 2005) is a collection of more than 1 million news articles. News articles have been gathered from more than 2000  news sources by ComeToMyHead in more than 1 year of activity. 

**[TREC question dataset](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/DATA-TREC)** <sub><sup>6 results collected</sup></sub>

Task involves classifying a question into 6 question types (whether the question is about person,
location, numeric information, etc.) (Li et al. 2002)

# Sentiment Analysis

**[SemEval-2016 Task 5](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/SemEval-2016-Task-5)** <sub><sup>245 results collected</sup></sub>

The SemEval ABSA task for 2016 (SE-ABSA16) gives the opportunity to participants to further experiment with English data (reviews) from the domains of SE-ABSA15 (laptops, restaurants, hotels) by providing new test datasets. In addition, SE-ABSA16 will also provide datasets in other than English languages. For each domain (e.g. restaurants) a common set of annotation guidelines will be used across all languages. Furthermore, SE-ABSA16 includes text-level annotations along with a suitable evaluation methodology.

**[SemEval-2015 Task 12](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/SemEval-2015-Task-12)** <sub><sup>32 results collected</sup></sub>

SemEval-2015 Task 12, a continuation of SemEval-2014 Task 4, aimed to foster research beyond sentence- or text-level sentiment classification towards Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to identify opinions expressed about specific entities (e.g., laptops) and their aspects (e.g., price). The task provided manually annotated reviews
in three domains (restaurants, laptops and hotels), and a common evaluation procedure. It attracted 93 submissions from 16 teams.

**[SemEval-2014 Task 4](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/SemEval-2014-Task-4)** <sub><sup>16 results collected</sup></sub>

Sentiment analysis is increasingly viewed as a vital task both from an academic and a commercial standpoint. The majority of current approaches, however, attempt to detect the overall polarity of a sentence, paragraph, or text span, regardless of the entities mentioned (e.g., laptops, restaurants) and their aspects (e.g., battery, screen; food, service). By contrast, this task is concerned with aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA), where the goal is to identify the aspects of given target entities and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. Datasets consisting of customer reviews with human-authored annotations identifying the mentioned aspects of the target entities and the sentiment polarity of each aspect will be provided.

**[MPQA Opinion Corpus](https://github.com/magizbox/underthesea/wiki/DATA-MPQA)** <sub><sup>9 results collected</sup></sub>

The MPQA Opinion Corpus (Wiebe et al. 2005) contains news articles from a wide variety of news sources manually annotated for opinions and other private states (i.e., beliefs, emotions, sentiments, speculations, etc.)
