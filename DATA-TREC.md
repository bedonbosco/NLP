[TREC question dataset](http://cogcomp.org/Data/QA/QC/)

Task involves classifying a question into 6 question types (whether the question is about person, location, numeric information, etc.) (Li and Roth, 2002)

## Datasets

5952 sentences. Data are collected from four sources: 4,500 English questions published by USC (Hovy et al., 2001),
about 500 manually constructed questions for a few rare classes, 894 TREC 8 and TREC 9 questions,
and also 500 questions from TREC 10 which serves as our test set.

6 coarse classes (ABBREVIATION, ENTITY, DESCRIPTION, HUMAN, LOCATION and NUMERIC VALUE) and 50 fine classes
