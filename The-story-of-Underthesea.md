# What is Underthesea?

`Underthesea` is a toolkit that supports the research and development of Vietnamese natural language processing. Underthesea was created in March 2017, in a context where Vietnam already had some good toolkits like [vn.vitk](https://github.com/phuonglh/vn.vitk) and [pyvi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvi), but still lacked a **complete**, **open-source**, **easy to install and use** toolkit comparable to English counterparts like [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/), [polyglot](https://github.com/aboSamoor/polyglot), and [spacy](https://spacy.io/).

# The Development Team's Goals

* Underthesea is a tool that is **easy to use**, **easy to install**, and comes with **comprehensive guides and documentation**.
* Underthesea is **open-source software**, allowing everyone to use it freely for educational, research, and commercial purposes.
* Underthesea **is always ready to support**, with all issues being responded to quickly.
* Underthesea supports language processing tasks including **text**, **speech**, and **handwritten image** processing.

In the distant future,

* Underthesea will **update** with the latest research in natural language processing.
* Underthesea will serve as a **bridge between Vietnamese NLP researchers**. Through Underthesea, researchers can implement ideas, integrate datasets, and share the latest research results with the community.
